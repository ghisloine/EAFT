# EAFT: Evolutionary Algoritms for GCC Flag Tuning

#### GA Tuner is autotuning tool which uses Genetic Algorithm for solving best flag set for C code compilation. Polybench dataset is used in this project but any other dataset could be used.

#### REQUIREMENTS

GCC-11 required. For better experience, macbook default gcc is not suitable because of optimization flags. Homebrew GCC-11.3.0 version tested.
